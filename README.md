# Description

- The purpose of this repo is to practice on using Test-driven development (TTD) process, by writting the tests then implement the actual code, made small changes with many cycles of Red-Green-Refactor. Also to practice on testing with pytest and pywatch.
- The program basically returns both Fibonacci series and Lucas series for any given number or a list of numbers.
